# Migration Tool

A tool to migrate from **Marzban** to **Marzneshin** in three simple steps:

1. [Data Export](app/export/readme.md)
2. [Data Import](app/importer/readme.md)
3. [Subscription Handling](app/handler/readme.md)

> **Note:** Our intention is not to disrespect the hard work of anyone. This project is designed for individuals who, for any reason, need to migrate. I appreciate the efforts of both the Marzban and Marzneshin teams and wish them success. ü§ù
